The following is a conversation with David Heinemeyer Hansen, also known as DHH. He is a legend in the programming and tech world, brilliant and insightful, sometimes controversial, and always fun to talk to. He's the creator of Ruby on Rails, which is an influential web development framework behind many websites used by millions of people, including Shopify, GitHub, and Airbnb. He is the co-owner and CTO of 37 Signals that created Basecamp, Hey, and Once. He is a New York Times bestselling author, together with his co-author, Jason Fried, of four books, Rework, Remote, Getting Real, and It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work. And on top of that, he's also a race car driver, including being a class winner at the legendary 24-hour Le Mans race. And now, a quick few-second mention of a sponsor. Check them out in the description or at lexfriedman.com slash sponsors. It's the best way to support this podcast. We got a couple of new sponsors, actually, so please go support them. Uplift Desk for beautiful workspaces, Lindy for building AI agents, Element for hydration, Shopify for selling stuff online, and NetSuite for your business. Choose wisely, my friends. And now, on to the full ad reads. I do try to make them interesting, but if you skip, please still check out our sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will, too. To get in touch with me, for whatever reason, go to lexfriedman.com slash contact. All right, let's go. This episode is brought to you by Uplift Desk. Like I mentioned, it's a new sponsor, but I've been using them for many, many years. I have six Uplift Desks, so three of them are in the podcast studio, so across many years, I don't know how many years, three, four years, if you see the sort of wood-colored desk in the podcast studio on camera, that those are.
