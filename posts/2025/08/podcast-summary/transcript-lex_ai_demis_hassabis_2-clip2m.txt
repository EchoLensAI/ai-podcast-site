This episode is brought to you by Hampton, a private community for high growth founders and CEOs. That's the interesting thing about starting a company and running a company, especially one that's growing really quickly, has to hire a lot, has to scale a lot. It's perhaps a little bit counterintuitive, but for the founder, it can be deeply lonely. I suppose that's one of the reasons they recommend to have a co-founder, but even outside of that, there's just a deep loneliness with putting it all on the line, risking everything, knowing that the chances of success are low, but if you do succeed, the gains are huge. And you have your heart in it, you have your dreams in it, you believe in it, but also there's a constant rollercoaster of fear and doubt and hope and moments of triumph.
